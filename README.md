# Optimizeing an Existing Website 

This is an OpenClassrooms student repo for project 4 by EDH.

## Project Description

### Scenario 

My friend Mike a freelance web designer who lives in Atlanta hired me to optimize his portfolio website for SEO, performance and accessibility.

### Requirements
 - Audit the existing website by identifying relevant SEO and accessibility issues. Select at least 10 actions to take to improve the website’s accessibility and/or SEO (including size and speed), noting an explanation and a credible reference for each one
 - Apply your recommendations to the code and submit the full source code of the improved website. The W3C HTML and CSS validator should not reveal any errors
 - Demonstrate that your adjustments have improved the website by providing a before-and-after comparison of the results from Google’s Lighthouse tool, accounting for all actions taken to optimize the website
 - Ensure accessibility according to WCAG2.1 standards

## Technologies Used 

Manual checking for SEO issues, WAVE, NVDA tools and manual checking for accessibility, Google Lighthouse for performance.  
I also learned about Google Analytics and Google Search Console regards to SEO strategies post-lunch of the website
but couldn't gain practical knowledge because of the nature of this project.
